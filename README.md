# my-learning-code
this code is used to track location from a list of ip in file.
this is mutlti-threaded code which can read huge amount of list in a file.
I have tested it with 1 Billion ips which it has completed in 40 sec.
this code will help in understanding multithreading scenerio with executor service.
